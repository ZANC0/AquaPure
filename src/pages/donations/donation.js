                    Sustainable water management involves using water resources in a way
                    that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of
                    future generations to meet their own needs. This means using water
                    efficiently and effectively, protecting and preserving water quality,
                    and ensuring that water resources are managed in a way that is
                    environmentally, socially, and economically sustainable. There are
                    several key elements to sustainable water management:
                    <br>
                        1: Water efficiency:
                        This involves using water in the most efficient way
                        possible, through measures such as water conservation, drip irrigation,
                        and the use of low-flow toilets and appliances.
                    </br>
                    <br>
                        2: Water conservation:
                        This involves protecting and preserving water resources through measures
                        such as protecting wetlands, preserving natural water storage systems,
                        and reducing water pollution.
