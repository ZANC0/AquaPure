                    Sustainable water management involves using water resources in a way that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. This means using water
                    efficiently and effectively, protecting and preserving water quality,
                    and ensuring that water resources are managed in a way that is
                    environmentally, socially, and economically sustainable. There are
                    several key elements to sustainable water management:
                    <br />
                    1: Water efficiency:
                    This involves using water in the most efficient way
                    possible, through measures such as water conservation, drip irrigation,
                    and the use of low-flow toilets and appliances.
                    <br />
                    2: Water conservation:
                    This involves protecting and preserving water resources through measures
                    such as protecting wetlands, preserving natural water storage systems,
                    and reducing water pollution.

                                The Soil Association is a British charity founded in 1946 with the mission of promoting organic farming and certification of organic foods. The founders, Lady Eve Balfour, Friend Sykes, and George Scott Williamson, were inspired by the Haughley Experiment which compared organic and chemical-based farming methods and showed the benefits of organic farming. The association was also established due to concerns over the use of herbicides in intensive agriculture.
