            <p>
              AquaPure is a university project dedicated to promoting water
              quality and environmental awareness. Our interactive map displays
              data on the quality of water sources throughout the UK, allowing
              you to explore the areas with the best and worst water quality.
              Our mission is to help people understand the importance of clean
              water and inspire action to protect our natural resources.

            <p>
              The AquaPure web application offers a variety of features to help
              users stay informed and raise awareness for people so they
              understand and take action to clean their water in their local
              areas. The application is designed to raise awareness about the
              importance of clean water and encourages users to take action to
              support organizations working to improve water quality. One of the
              key features of the application is the interactive map. This map
              allows registered users to view water pollutant readings at
              different locations, search for a specific location, view their
              current GPS location, and select different map filters.
              Additionally, registered users can submit their own test kit
              results to update the interactive map. This feature allows users
              to stay informed about the water quality in their area and take
              action to improve it. Another important feature of the application
              is the shop. Users can purchase test kits and other merchandise
              from the shop. This feature allows users to actively participate
              in improving water quality by testing the water in their area and
              taking action based on the results. The Quiz/Game feature is also
              an interesting feature for the users, this feature allows
              registered users to earn points by answering questions about water
              quality and related topics. These points can then be used to make
              donations to organizations working to improve water quality. This
              feature not only helps users learn more about water quality but
              also encourages them to take action to improve it. The application
              also includes a digital assistance (AquaBot) which can be used to
              answer questions and provide relevant responses. This feature is
              particularly useful for users who may have questions about water
              quality or related topics. Overall, the AquaPure web application
              provides a variety of tools and features to help users stay
              informed and take action to improve water quality. It is designed
              to raise awareness about the importance of clean water and
              encourages users to take action to support organizations working
              to improve water quality.

                While the UK is known for its high-quality tap water, the state
                of our bodies of water remains a significant concern. In fact,
                there are several alarming facts regarding water quality in the
                UK that cannot be ignored.

                    Every year, companies in the UK are fined millions of pounds
                    for pollution incidents - In 2021, the courts fined water
                    companies a record of Â£102.49 million for pollution. In 2020
                    there were over 400,000 discharges of untreated sewage into
                    UK rivers and almost 5,500 discharges into UK coastal
                    bathing waters. A recent report by the Environment Agency
                    (EA) found that two thirds of the sector were rated no
                    better than requiring improvement (2 stars) or poor (1 star)
                    according to their EPA standards.

                  <p>
                    The UK ranks as one of the worst European countries for
                    coastal water quality, and only 14% of its rivers warrant
                    âgoodâ ecological status. Poor water quality damages natural
                    ocean ecosystems and habitats such as kelp beds and
                    seagrasses, reduces biodiversity and the oceanâs ability to
                    store carbon, and threatens human health.

                    Water pollution can lead to devestating consequences for
                    both wildlife and ecosystems. Not only can it diminish
                    biodiversity, but it can also have far-reaching effects on
                    food webs, natural cycles, and habitat quality. Moreover, it
                    can accelerate the spread of invasive species, increase
                    disease outbreaks, impair reproductive and growth rates, and
                    even threaten survival rates of a variety of species,
                    including fish, birds, mammals, amphibians, reptiles,
                    insects, and plants. An incident that highlights the dangers
                    of water pollution occurred in Essex in 2019, where a sewage
                    spill led to the death of 5,000 fish.

                The project is to create a web application called âAquaPureâ

                Sustainable Development Goals and some aspects of Goal 14 (Life

                local areas. This will hopefully hit our goal for clean water
