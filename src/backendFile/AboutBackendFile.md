# AquaPure Backend File

The Backend File is located in this folder.

## To use AquaPure's Backend:

1. Connect to AnyConnect VPN,
2. Unzip the AquaPure Backend file,
3. Run the file in Eclips or IntelliJ (Do NOT use Visual Studio Code)(Once the Backend is running you can have access to Accounts and Admin features).

### The path for the Java Class that should be running for the features:

/aquapurebackend/src/main/java/com/backend/aquapurebackend/AquapurebackendApplication.java

##Â Changes on the Backend File:

1. If any changes are made compress (.ZIP) the file and replace the older file in this folder,
2. It is very important that you compress (.ZIP) the file, because GitHub corrupts the Backend files if it is pushes directly.
